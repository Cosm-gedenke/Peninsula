MANUAL TO UNDERSTAND PROCEDURES BEHIND THE CODE

NOTE: code which respective comments have numbers correspond to what it being explained in it

1- memset(&echoserveraddress, 0, sizeof(echoserveraddress))
Purpose: Initialize the entire sockaddr_in structure to zeros.

Reason: ensures that the padding bytes are cleared, prevents garbage values from interfering

note: it only affects the local value of echoserveraddress


2- echoserveraddress.sin_family = AF_INET
Purpose: sets the address family to IPv4
NOTE: change to AF_INET6 if you want IPv6

3- echoserveraddress.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY)
Purpose: set the IP address the server will bind to

NOTE: INADDR_ANY = any network available
	  htonl() Host To Network Long, converts the 32 bit integer from the host's byte order to network byte order

4- bind(sock, (struct sockaddr *) &echoservaddress, sizeof(echoservaddress))

Purpose: Associates the socket(the file descriptor sock) with a local IP address and port number

NOTE: tells the OS to deliver to this socket data arriving the local IP, which is the corresponding port
      the struct cast is used to specify the IPv4
